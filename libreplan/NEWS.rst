Version 1.4.0 (29 Apr 2013)
---------------------------

Summary
~~~~~~~

We are proud to announce a new LibrePlan major version, with several
improvements and new features, as all the fixes developed since the last 1.3.3
version. These are the most representative changes:

* Integrated connector to import JIRA issues into LibrePlan projects, by
  selecting the JIRA issue labels that the user wants to be managed with
  LibrePlan.
* Timesheets loader from TimEnterprise tracking tool, to enable showing the
  progresses tracked with Tim into their corresponding LibrePlan projects.
* Importer of Microsoft Project and Planner files, which will create on
* LibrePlan the corresponding gantts with their tasks, dependencies, milestones
  and calendars.
* User-configurable filtering options for company view and resources load,
  specifying the time filtering options and label/criteria restrictions.
* Extended information on the resources load availability and overtime available
  on the advanced search of the assignment popup.
* Chinese language is now available. With this new translation, LibrePlan has
  been translated into 13 languages.

Version 1.3.3 (21 Dec 2012)
---------------------------

Summary
~~~~~~~

A new minor version of LibrePlan including all the fixes done since previous
version and some new features that have been developed lately.

Highlights:

* A custom Mobile Application has been developed. This is a tool to allow
  LibrePlan users to access the tasks they are assigned to, from any project,
  report worked hours and check their progresses from a mobile device.
  http://www.libreplan.com/download/mobile-application/
  You can download this application for free to any of the currently supported
  platforms, and configure it to connect to your LibrePlan installation to start
  using it.

Apart from this. Several changes have also been made on LibrePlan, of which the
most remarkable are:

* Performance improvements on the project listing window (specially when
  working with a lot of projects), and on the project creation and WBS
  manipulation.

* We have changed the internals of the custom JavaScript files inside LibrePlan,
  to avoid some problems due to the caching of those files, and creating issues
  that forced manual cache refresh when upgrading LibrePlan installations.

* An informative message has been added to the installation package to suggest
  Java configuration tunning, in order to avoid Memory problems.

* The visibility of the projects on the company view has been modified, to show
  by default all projects but CANCELLED and STORED.

Version 1.3.2 (30 Nov 2012)
---------------------------

Summary
~~~~~~~

A new minor version of LibrePlan including all the fixes done since previous
version and some new features that have been developed lately. It also includes
some of the tasks done during the 1st LibrePlan Hackfest arranged in A Coruña
the 8th of November.

Highlights:

* Improvements in "Project Status" report:

  * New columns showing information about costs.
  * Included filter by criteria and labels.
  * Some data are written in red when the planning (or estimation) is not
    enough.

* Planning adjustment according to timesheets: New feature providing the
  possibility to adapt the Gantt view to reflect the reality with the data
  extracted from the timesheets. Moreover, it includes the option to mark a task
  as finished in the timesheets. On adjusting the planning acoording to
  timesheets if one task has been marked as finished in the timesheets then,
  additionally, a new progress type of type timesheets with a 100% measurement.

* New DELETE operation in order elements web service: The new web service
  operation allows to remove whole projects or individual tasks on top of the
  current functionality to import/update projects or tasks.

* New bound resources web service operations: 3 new web services have been
  implemented related to bound resources. They provide the list of assigned
  tasks, get the personal timesheets of a task and update the personal
  timesheets data for a bound user.

* Other:

  * Compatibility issues with OpenJDK 7 fixed. This solves the problems with the
    latest Ubuntu and Fedora versions.

  * The project planning persectives have been protected in order to avoid
    leaving them without saving. There is a new configuration variable to define
    the number of seconds since the last saving in order to activate a warning
    when the user leaves the planning views. Several users have reported
    inconvenient data losses due to abandoning the project edition without
    saving. With this warning this situation is fixed. By default the number of
    seconds is configured to 30 and if you set it to 0 you disable the warning.

  * Option to edit manually if a user is a database or LDAP user.

  * By clicking on the project name in the left side part of the projects
    planning perspective (home page), the user is able to enter directly into
    the project planning edition.

  * The list of project states has been reviewed and expanded. The final list is
    composed by: PRE-SALES, OFFERED, OUTSOURCED, ACCEPTED, STARTED, ON HOLD,
    FINISHED, CANCELLED and STORED.

Version 1.3.0 (26 Jul 2012)
---------------------------

Summary
~~~~~~~

After some delay the LibrePlan team is proud to announce the release of a new
major version of the tool, LibrePlan 1.3. Hence, for those of you who were
waiting for it, thank you for your patient and understanding! :)

In LibrePlan 1.3 we have fulfilled the targets that we had identified as top
priority in the roadmap and this makes us happy, because of the work done and
because we think that with the new features included we are providing LibrePlan
with new capabilities. With LibrePlan 1.3 we are making the planner better for
collaborative, real-time scenarios where many different people in the
organization interacts with the projects planning.

The main features which come with this version are:

* Resource binding to users
* Monthly timesheets
* Project dashboard
* Expenses
* Permission enhancements
* Currency support
* Work breakdown structure (WBS) setting up behavior
* Outsourcing improvements
* Concurrent usage improvements
* Revamped menu
* Languages supported
* Timesheets search window enhancements

Version 1.2.4 (23 May 2012)
---------------------------

Summary
~~~~~~~

This is a new minor release of LibrePlan. It includes all the fixes done since
previous version 1.2.3 together with a new language (Czech) supported in the
application.

Some highlights:

* Fixed problem in "Hours Worked Per Resource" report with standard work
  reports.

* Solved small issue in project web service in order to allow add tasks to an
  already existent project.

* Remove scenarios option in configuration window.

* Reviewed algorithm to do generic allocations in order to avoid any problem if
  there are more than one generic allocation in the same task.

* Added favicon in all the windows.

* Improved web services documentation with the list of available services.

* Fixed problem using deadlines.

* LibrePlan is now translated into Czech language thanks to the work done by
  Zbyněk Schwarz.

* This is the first version when we are providing files for using MySQL
  database. This has been possible thanks to the upgrade to Liquibase 2.0.5.

Version 1.2.3 (19 Apr 2012)
---------------------------

Summary
~~~~~~~

A new minor version of the LibrePlan 1.2.* version family. The main changes
included in this new release are:

* Money based cost monitoring system: This is a new feature that allows users to
  monitor the project cost based on the money spent comparing it to the budget.
  Users can configure the budget for each task and, after this, LibrePlan
  calculates the cost in money already spent using the worked time tracked, the
  type of worked hours (standard, overtime,...) and the cost of each resource
  hour according to the value defined by the cost category the worker belongs.

* Polish language: LibrePlan is now translated into Polish thanks to the work
  done by Krzysztof Kamecki.

* Other minor enhancements and bugfixing:

  * Fixed database synchronization issues which appeared on changing planning
    points in the WBS. The problems arose when planning points were moved from
    children to their parents or vice versa.
  * Default users (user, wsreader and wswriter) are disabled by default.
  * Fixed resource usage grouped by criteria load analysis that was being bad
    calculated inside a project.
  * Task duration was not being refreshed properly when doing an allocation and
    you needed to apply the allocation twice to see it right.
  * START_IN_FIXED_DATE constraint caused that the project duration was bad
    calculated in company view.

Version 1.2.2 (15 Mar 2012)
---------------------------

Summary
~~~~~~~

Minor release of LibrePlan including all the maintanance work and small
enhancements done since 1.2.1.

The major developments which come with this new version are the next ones:

* We are going to provide for the first time RPM packages for the main
  GNU/Linux distributions based on this package format. This has been a
  contribution of Juan A. Suárez Romero.

* LibrePlan interface is available in two new languages thanks to our growing
  translators community:

  * French. Thanks to Stephane Ayache, Guillaume Postaire and
    Philippe Poumaroux.
  * Dutch. Thanks to Jeroen Baten.

* Two new planning features have been added:

  * The Gantt chart has been improved to include a graphic representation of the
    start date of a project through a dashed black vertical line. This is very
    useful to have always visible when a project starts.
  * If there are violated dependencies in the Gantt charts because of the higher
    precendence of the task constraints, the dependencies are painted in red.

* Some small user experience enhancements:

  * The project status is displayed in the Gantt chart next to the breadcrumb.
  * States that represent a closed project (finished, canceled, stored) are
    represented in the projects planning view (home page of the application)
    with a grey color. So, from now on the code color is the next one:

    * Light blue. For projects without any allocated task and not closed.
    * Dark blue. For project with any allocated task and not closed.
    * Grey. For closed projects.

  * To measure progress is now a bit faster. The focus is automatically set in
    the textbox of the row just created for the new progress value.

* LDAP authentication system has been improved:

  * LDAP users cannot change the password in the LibrePlan interface.
  * Managers cannot manage LDAP user roles if they are being imported from the
    configured directory.

Apart from this, the new versions come with fixes of many issues detected by
our users and that can be read in the Changes section.

Version 1.2.0 (01 Dec 2011)
---------------------------

Summary
~~~~~~~

In the current 1.2.0 version the project has been renamed to LibrePlan and this
will be the official name for the project from now on. With the new name,
decided by the community, we are remarking that LibrePlan is a generic purpose
planning tool, suitable to many sectors.

Besides, with this new version, the project has a new image and a revamped
website that you can visit at http://www.libreplan.com/

This new major version comes with important new features apart from all the
bugfixing done since the 1.1 major release. Among the new features, these are
the most relevant ones:

* Migration to ZK 5 Community Edition.

  LibrePlan uses ZK framework as UI toolkit and in this release has been
  migrated the interface from ZK 3.6 to ZK 5.0.

  ZK 5 was incompatible with version version 3.6 and this movement have implied:

  * Reimplementing LibrePlan custom UI widgets in ZK 5.0 architecture

  * Providing an implementation in ZK 5.0 for widgets in 3.6 version which
    changed their license and which are not open source anymore.

  * Reviewing all the application windows and to do small configuration and
    formatting changes.

  This allows us to get advantage of the latest innovations in rich web
  interfaces and enjoy both the performance and architectural enhancements of
  this new ZK version.

* Resource allocation engine enhancements.

  The planner engine has been improved with three new functionalities regarding
  to allocation engine:

  * Task movements in Gantt view keeps the configured allocation function.
    Before this, if you configured a stretches function or sigmoid function in
    a resource allocation and the task was moved because a dependency or
    constraint set by the user, the allocation function applied in the new
    point was the flat function. Now, the configured stretches or sigmoid
    function is used.

  * Manual allocation automatic detection in advanced allocation. Now if the
    user changes the allocation of a task in advanced allocation window, the
    type of allocation is automatically tracked as manual.

  * Manual allocation locking support in Gantt view. So far if a task had a
    manual allocation and was moved in the Gantt, the custom allocation was
    lost and a flat function was applied. In this version, a keep manual
    allocation strategy has been implemented. It consists of disabling the
    automatic movement of those allocated tasks in the Gantt by being
    configured with a START IN FIXED DATE constraint after the manual
    allocation. If the user wants to move these tasks, he has to change in
    first place the allocation function used and, in second place, has to
    remove the constraint. In this way, the manual allocation configured is not
    lost by accident.

* Sharing state between perspectives.

  The project planning in LibrePlan is achieved by using several perspectives:

  * Project scheduling (Gantt).
  * Project details (WBS).
  * Resource load
  * Advanced allocation.

  Until this version, the user had to save before abandoning a perspective to
  avoid losing the changes on going to another. To improve this, in this
  release, the planning data has been shared among all the project perspectives
  and on saving in one of them, all the planning data is stored.

  This a more natural way of creating the project plan. Now the user can move
  freely among the project views configuring different things and, on reaching
  a desired state, he can ask to persist changes.

  Besides, with this new feature, the loss of changes by accident is prevented
  on a perspective change without saving first.

* LDAP authentication and authorization module.

  In this version the possibility of using LDAP as backend for users has been
  implemented.

  An LDAP authentication and authorization module has been developed. With
  this, it is possible to use the users configured in the company directory
  without the need to create them in LibrePlan manually.

  The main features of this module are:

  * User passwords saving in LibrePlan database after right authentication
    option. This allows the LDAP users enter the application if the LDAP is
    off-line.

  * Role matching support. It is possible to map LDAP roles to LibrePlan
    permissions. Two strategies are provided: Group strategy (all the users
    under a node) and property strategy (property of the node user with all the
    role values).

* My account area.

  It has been developed a new top level menu entry called *My account* with
  several options with a per user scope. This means that they are operations
  that concern only to the connected user which is configuring them.

  The operations included in this zone are:

  * Personal data. User can manage his contact information

  * Application preferences. User can select the language of the application
    and if if the load charts of the planning windows appear folded or
    unfolded  by default.

  * Password administration. User can change his own password.

* Functional tests.

  One of the maxims of LibrePlan is to create a project with good quality. For
  this reason in this version functional tests to the project have been
  incorporated into the project.

  Functional tests are black-box tests in which the interface of the program is
  tested. The tool which has been chosen is Sahi and it allows verifying that
  all functionalities keep working successfully.

  An initial set of Sahi tests have been developed and they will be increased
  as time passes.

* Other minor tasks implemented:

  * Internationalization. Some strings were not being translated accordingly to
    the language used under certain conditions.

  * Default login auto-completion is now configurable, you can disable it from
    the configuration window.

  * Now when editing contents, information identifiying the element being
    edited is always displayed on the page heading.

  * Work reports minute detail level support has been added. This allows users
    to specify how many hours and minutes they have devoted to each task.
    Reports have been updated accordingly to include the work time in minutes
    too.

  * LibrePlan web services have now a new method to export only one entity by
    specifying its code.

  * Russian and Portuguese translations. Apart from English, Spanish and
    Galician now LibrePlan is also available in Russian and Portuguese.

Version 1.1.0 (19 May 2011)
---------------------------

New major version of NavalPlan. Apart from a lot of bugfixing the main features
included in this version are:

* Fixed problem with WebKit based browsers.

  Now WebKit based browsers (Chrome, Safari, Epiphany) and last version of
  Firefox are fully supported.

* Fixed issues in printing.

  Printing uses a WebKit based solution and thus failed occasionally because of
  the previous issue that is fixed now.

* Over allocation control support.

  In 1.0 version it was not possible to configure a limit of overtime for
  workers. From now on users can configure calendars with this feature. You can
  set a maximum overtime in each regular work week day or in a specific
  exception day.

  This provides a lot of flexibility in the resource allocation strategies. You
  can do allocations without generating overtime or generating a controlled
  amount of it. In this way, users can ask the application to calculate the
  soonest finish date for a task taking into account the overtime allowed.

  A last clarification about this control is that is done per task. The maximum
  allocation assigned to a worker is observed per task. This means that if you
  have two tasks in the same period assigned to the same resource, taking into
  both tasks, you can surpass the overtime constraint.

* Hierarchical criteria enforced.

  Criteria in NavalPlan are like dynamic roles that resources can satisfy and
  can be hierarchical. This means that one general criterion can include other
  more specific criteria inside. For instance, it is possible to configure the
  general criterion Engineer with two children like Electric Engineer and
  Software Engineer.

  This feature was disabled in version 1.0.4 and is provided again after some
  fixes were done.

* New generic allocation algorithm.

  Generic allocation is the assignment based on criteria. You specify the set
  of criteria which must be satisfied by the workers who are able to do the
  task and, after this, NavalPlan looks for them and selects the ones less
  loaded to be planned.

  The algorithm which selects the workers to be assigned to a task when
  generic allocation is used was improved in several points:

  * The sharing hours process allocates workers when selected up to load 100%.
  * On selecting workers for a date inside a task, the new algorithm tries to
    use the workers assigned in the previous days of the task. In this way, the
    algorithm is not based just in load but selects first the previously used
    resources if they have free hours.

* Project scheduling window new features.

  In the project scheduling window four improvements were done:

  * Positioning system on zoom changes. Now when the user changes the zoom
    level in the Gantt planning window, after the screen has been refreshed
    the scroll is moved so the user will see the same time period.
  * Calendar exception days are shown in the Gantt planning grid with a
    different background color. At day and week zoom level the project
    calendar is used to highlight the non-working days.
  * Violated dependencies are highlighted. A red color is used to draw
    dependencies that are violated.
  * Resource load chart precision was improved. Now two points per time unit
    are represented and this makes the chart more accurate in the resource load
    chart which is displayed in the bottom of Project Planning view, Project
    scheduling window, company resource usage screen and project resource usage
    screen.

* Default password change notification protocol.

  It was implemented a mechanism to control if the password for the default
  users have been changed. Default accounts which are provided are:

  * admin/admin. This user is the user with administration privileges.
  * user/user. This is a common user without administration privileges.
  * wswriter/wswriter. This user has write permissions to use then web
    services operations which require modify or insert data in NavalPlan.
  * wsreader/wsreader. This user has read permissions to the use web services
    operations which only require read permissions.

  The mechanism consists of showing warning messages in the left bottom corner
  of the screen remembering which default user accounts have still configured
  the default password.

* Minute accuracy in calendars and allocation windows.

  In 1.0 version calendars are expressed in hours the same as the amount of
  allocated time in tasks. This means that users cannot use minutes if they
  want to have a higher detail level in the plans.

  This was changed and now is possible to specify the calendars and the
  allocations in hours and minutes. In the allocation screens this is done
  with the ":" separator in the input boxes.

  A thing which is pending to be implemented is to allow estimate the WBS for
  a project in hours and minutes. In 1.1 is only allowed in hours.

* Limiting resources new insertion algorithm.

  It was implemented a new algorithm for inserting tasks in points where there
  are already tasks planned in the limiting resources. The new algorithm moves
  the tasks respecting better the order of the tasks already planned.

* Calendar interface revamp

  User interface for calendars was improved to provide an easier use.

* WBS screen

  This window was tested deeply and errors related to moving nodes in the tree
  were corrected.
