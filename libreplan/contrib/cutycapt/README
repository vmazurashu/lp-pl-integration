CutyCapt Debian packaging
=========================

This directory includes control files for building CutyCapt packages for
Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu) so it can be cleanly installed.

Usage
=====

1. Get the CutyCapt sources, from http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net

2. Copy the included "debian" subdirectory over the CutyCapt source tree.

3. If needed, install the build-time dependencies::

     apt-get install libqt4-dev

4. Create the package using the usual incantation::

     debian/rules binary

5. Now you may install the created ``.deb`` package::

     dpkg -i ../cutycapt_*.deb
