 *     It can be applied to a {@link IDataBootstrap} to indicate the order in which it will be executed.
 *     It's ensured that if a data bootstrap has a priority value greater than another one it will be executed before.
 *     If two data bootstraps have the same priority value the order is unspecified.
 *     If a data bootstrap doesn't have this annotation it's like it would have a value of zero.
