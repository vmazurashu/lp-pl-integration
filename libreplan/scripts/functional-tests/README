Introduction
------------

Inside ``scripts/functional-tests/`` folder of LibrePlan source code, you can find
a set of functional tests. They consist of different files and each file groups tests
related to the same functionality.

Each file is called ``<menu-option>_test.sah`` and represent all the tests developed
for an individual option of the menu. Additionally, there are a set of fixed tests
that are always included.

* Create ``<menu-option>``
* Create ``<menu-option>`` with duplicate type (it should not be allowed)
* Create ``<menu-option>`` with empty type (it should not be allowed)
* Create ``<menu-option>`` with duplicate name (it should not be allowed)
* Edit ``<menu-option>``
* Delete ``<menu-option>``


Requirements
------------

To run these tests it's necessary to have installed `Sahi <http://sahi.co.in/>`_.

You can download it at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sahi/files/sahi-v35/20110719/install_sahi_v35_20110719.jar/download

To install it, execute the following command where you have the previously download file::

    $ java -jar install_sahi_v35_20110719.jar

You can also see the instructions in sahi's page at:
http://sahi.co.in/w/using-sahi


Run the Scripts
---------------

.. WARNING::

    All tests use English as default language. So, if
    your browser language is different from this, they will NOT PASS

Once installed the program you have two ways to execute the tests:

* With a Graphical User Interface (GUI): Follow the instructions at: http://sahi.co.in/w/using-sahi

* On the console:

  * To run sahi scripts, you need to start Sahi::

    $ start_sahi.sh

  * And inside ``scripts/functional-tests/`` you can run them with::

    $ testrunner.sh yourtest.sah <initial-url> <browser>

.. WARNING::

    If you modify Sahi default installation path (``~/sahi/``), you must
    change the path in ``scripts/functional-tests/sahi-common-env.sh``

It's possible to run more than one script at the same time using a <file.suite>. You
can see some information in:
http://sahi.co.in/w/Running+multiple+tests+in+batch+mode

See more information about how to run at: http://sahi.co.in/w/using-sahi
